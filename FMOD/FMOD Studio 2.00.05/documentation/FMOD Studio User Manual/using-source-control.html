<h1>13. Using Source Control</h1>
<p>Source control (also known as revision control) is a means of managing and tracking changes made to collections of files. Source control systems such as Perforce, SVN, and Team Foundation Server have many uses, from rolling back to earlier versions of a project to facilitating collaboration between users, and are widely used throughout the games industry.</p>
<p>FMOD Studio is integrated with several of the most common source control systems, and can support additional source control system integrations via scripts. This chapter explains how to make use of these integrations.</p>
<p>This chapter assumes that you've already installed a source control system and have access to a repository. If you haven't yet installed source control software or gained access to a repository, consult your source control software's documentation to find out how.</p>
<h2 id="adding-your-project-to-a-repository"><a href="#adding-your-project-to-a-repository">13.1 Adding Your Project to a Repository</a></h2>
<p>Before you can take advantage of FMOD Studio's source control integration, your FMOD Studio project must be added to your source control repository.</p>
<p>Your FMOD Studio project only has to be added to the repository once. If it has already been added to the repository by another member of your team, you don't need to add it yourself. Instead, you should get a local copy of the project as described in the <a href="using-source-control.html#getting-a-local-copy-of-your-project">Getting a Local Copy of Your Project</a> section of this chapter.</p>
<p>Before adding your FMOD Studio project to the repository, make sure that its <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#assets-folder">assets folder</span class="dead-link"> and <a href="glossary.html#built-banks-output-directory">built banks output directory</a> properties are set correctly.</p>
<ul>
<li>The built banks output directory is the same for all users of a project, so it should be set to a relative or absolute path that everyone collaborating on the project agrees on. It is possible to change the bank build directory later, but doing so changes it for all users.</li>
<li>If any member of your team wishes to use an assets folder outside of the FMOD Studio project folder, all members of your team should use an assets folder outside of the FMOD Studio project folder. This is to prevent files in the project folder's assets subdirectory from bloating the size of the project in the repository. Each user may set a different relative or absolute path for his or her asset directory, as long as each path is outside of the FMOD Studio project folder.</li>
</ul>
<p>The easiest way to add your FMOD Studio project to a repository is to open the preferences dialog, click on the source control tab, select your source control integration of choice from the "Integration Type" dropdown, then follow the integration-specific instructions below.</p>
<p>It is also possible, but not recommended, to add a project to a repository by using an external tool such as P4V or tortoiseSVN. If you do this, it is important to exclude the following files from the repository:</p>
<ul>
<li>The contents of your FMOD Studio project folder's <code>Build</code> subdirectory, if you have decided not to check in built banks.</li>
<li>The contents of your FMOD Studio project folder's <code>Assets</code> subdirectory, if you have decided not to check in asset files.</li>
<li>Your FMOD Studio project folder's <code>.user</code>, <code>.cache</code>, and <code>.unsaved</code> subdirectories, if present. Note that these folders are only created as needed, and so are not present in all FMOD Studio projects. They may also be hidden from view, depending on your operating system's settings.</li>
</ul>
<p>Failing to exclude these files from the repository will unnecessarily increase the size of your project on the server, and may result in loss of user settings, project validation errors, and other errors.</p>
<h3 id="adding-your-project-to-a-perforce-repository"><a href="#adding-your-project-to-a-perforce-repository">13.1.1 Adding Your Project to a Perforce Repository</a></h3>
<p>If you use a Perforce (also known as Helix or Helix Core) repository, you can add your project to the repository entirely through FMOD Studio as long as your project is located inside an existing Perforce workspace on your local disk.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Open the preferences dialog and click on the source control tab.</p>
<p>The "Integration Type" dropdown menu is the only control that appears under the source control tab right now.</p>
<p><img alt="The Source Control Tab, Empty" src="images/emptySourceControlTab.png" /></p>
<p>Each integration type has different settings to tweak and fields to fill out, so nothing else is shown in the dialog until you've selected one.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on the "Integration Type" dropdown menu, and select "Perforce."</p>
<p>Fields for entering your Perforce connection settings properties appear below the dropdown menu, along with checkboxes for enabling source control integration for assets and built banks.</p>
<p><img alt="The Source Control Tab, Perforce" src="images/perforceSourceControlTab.png" /></p>
<p>The server and user fields might already be filled in. FMOD Studio automatically detects existing Perforce configuration files, and uses the contents of those files to fill out the server and user fields if it can. That said, FMOD Studio can't detect your Perforce password, and if you use multiple open Perforce connections it might not select the one you want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the server and user fields are blank or don't contain the right server address and user, enter the server you want to connect to and the user you want to connect as.</p>
<p>If you don't know the I.P. address and port of your Perforce server, ask your network administrator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your Perforce server requires a password, enter that password in the "password (optional)" field.</p>
<p>Some Perforce servers don't require passwords, but most do. If you don't know the password for the user you're connecting as, contact your Perforce system administrator.</p>
<p>Most workspaces do not require a specific host machine. If the workspace you're using does not require a specific host machine, leave the host field blank.</p>
<p>If the workspace you're using can only be used by a specific host machine, enter the name of that host machine into the host field. To find out whether your workspace requires a specific host machine, consult your Perforce administrator.</p>
<p>A few moments after you finish putting in your password and host machine, the "client workspace" dropdown menu fills with a list of available workspaces.</p>
<p>It can take a few seconds for the list to update, depending on the speed of the network you're using.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on the "Integration Type" dropdown menu, and select the workspace in which you saved the FMOD Studio project.</p>
<p>The dropdown menu closes, and displays the workspace you selected.</p>
<p>The connection is now set up and ready to be used.</p>
<p>The next step is to decide whether to include your project's built banks and asset files as part of the repository. By default, both assets and built banks are included.</p>
<p><img alt="The Enable Source Control Integration for Assets and Built Banks Checkboxes" src="images/perforceAssetAndBankInclusionCheckboxes.png" /></p>
<p>Including your project's assets in the repository allows those assets to benefit from source control, but also increases the size of the repository. Disabling source control integration for assets may be useful if your team is planning to store their assets on a shared network drive or similar shared location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you do not want your project's assets to be included in the repository, uncheck the "enable source control integration for assets" checkbox.</p>
<p>Including your built banks in the repository increases the size of the repository, but allows those banks to benefit from source control. Disabling source control integration for built banks may be useful if every member of your team is comfortable with building FMOD Studio banks using FMOD Studio.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you do not want your project's built banks to be included in the repository, uncheck the "enable source control integration for assets" checkbox.</p>
<p>Once you have decided whether to include banks and assets in the repository, your FMOD Studio project is ready to be submitted to your Perforce repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Close the preferences dialog.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select "File &gt; Source Control &gt; Sync Latest, Merge, and Commit..."</p>
<p>A dialog appears, informing you that synchronizing and merging the project is not undoable, and that clicking "Yes" will automatically save the project.</p>
<p><img alt="The Synchronize to Latest, Merge &amp; Commit Project Dialog" src="images/smcConfirmationDialog.png" /></p>
<p>This command clears the undo stack, just as if you had closed and re-opened FMOD Studio. If there's some change you need to undo before adding your project to the repository, this is your last chance to click "No" and undo that change. Otherwise:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click "Yes."</p>
<p>After a few moments, the submit dialog appears. Its "Changes" tab displays a list of every element of your project to be submitted. At the bottom of the dialog is a field labeled "Enter description here" and a grayed-out button labeled "Submit."</p>
<p><img alt="The Submit Dialog" src="images/submitDialog.png" /></p>
<p>The Changes tab displays everything that's going to be submitted to the repository. In this case, that means the entire project.</p>
<p>There's also an "On Hold" tab that lets you exclude specific parts of the project from being submitted, but you don't need to use that tab when submitting a project to the repository the first time. (For information about the On Hold tab, see the <a href="using-source-control.html#committing-changes">committing Changes</a> section of this chapter.)</p>
<p>Whatever you type into the "Enter description here" field is used as the description of the changelist in Perforce. It's good practice to write a description that can be easily understood without additional context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on the "Enter description here" field and type "Added FMOD Studio project to repository."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click the Submit button.</p>
<p>A progress dialog appears, and starts to fill. Once it reaches 100%, it disappears. Depending on the size of your project and the speed of your network, it may take a few minutes to completely fill.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With that, your project has been added to your Perforce repository.</p>
<h2 id="getting-a-local-copy-of-your-project"><a href="#getting-a-local-copy-of-your-project">13.2 Getting a Local Copy of Your Project</a></h2>
<p>In order to work on an FMOD Studio project, you must have a local copy of that project on your machine. If you were the one who submitted the project to your team's source control repository, you can continue using the local copy that you submitted. If the machine you are using does not already have a local copy of the project, however, you must obtain one.</p>
<p>The easiest way to obtain a local copy of a project already in your source control repository is to use FMOD Studio's "File &gt; Source Control &gt; Browse for Project..." menu item and follow the integration-specific instructions below.</p>
<p>Note that you only need to open a project with "File &gt; Source Control &gt; Browse for Project..." once on each machine that you use. This is because opening a project in this way automatically creates a local copy of that project, which can subsequently be opened by selecting "File &gt; Open..." Opening a project with "File &gt; Open..." is slightly faster than opening it with "File &gt; Source Control &gt; Browse for Project..."</p>
<p>It is also possible to obtain a local copy of your project by using an external tool, such as P4V or tortiseSVN. If you do this, you will need to set up the local copy's Perforce settings manually. For more information on how to get a local copy of a folder in a source control repository by using an external tool, see that tool's documentation.</p>
<h3 id="getting-a-local-copy-of-your-project-from-a-perforce-repository"><a href="#getting-a-local-copy-of-your-project-from-a-perforce-repository">13.2.1 Getting a Local Copy of Your Project from a Perforce Repository</a></h3>
<p>Before creating a local copy through FMOD Studio, you'll need a local workspace for the Perforce repository in which your project is stored. If you don't already have a local Perforce workspace and don't know how to create one, consult your Perforce administrator.</p>
<p>Once you have a local Perforce workspace, you can use FMOD Studio to make a local copy of any FMOD Studio project in the corresponding Perforce depot.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Select "File &gt; Source Control &gt; Browse for Project"</p>
<p>The open dialog appears. The integration type dropdown menu is set to Perforce. Fields for entering your Perforce connection settings properties appear below the dropdown menu.</p>
<p><img alt="The Open Dialog" src="images/browseForProjectDialogOpen.png" /></p>
<p>If you're using a custom script-based integration, the dropdown might be set to that integration instead of to Perforce. If it is, it's easy to change.</p>
<p>If the dropdown is set to Perforce, the server and user fields might already be filled in. FMOD Studio automatically detects open Perforce connections, and uses the details of those connections to fill out those fields if it can. That said, FMOD Studio can't detect your Perforce password, and if you use multiple open Perforce connections it might not select the one you want.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the server and user fields are blank or don't contain the right server address and user, enter the server you want to connect to and the user you want to connect as.</p>
<p>If you don't know the I.P. address and port of your Perforce server, ask your network administrator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your Perforce server requires a password, enter that password in the "Password (optional)" field.</p>
<p>Some Perforce servers don't require passwords, but most do. If you don't know the password for the user you're connecting as, contact your Perforce system administrator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the workspace is on your local machine, leave the host field blank. If the workspace is located on a machine other than the one you are using, enter that machine's IP Address and listening port into the host field.</p>
<p>Once you've finished entering connection details, you can continue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click the "Find" button at the bottom of the dialog.</p>
<p>A progress dialog appears as FMOD Studio searches the Perforce depot. After a few moments, the dialog displays a browser populated with the projects in that depot.</p>
<p><img alt="The Open Dialog" src="images/browseForProjectDialogBrowser.png" /></p>
<p>This browser allows you to select a specific FMOD Studio project to create a local copy of and load. If the project you want a local copy of is not displayed in the browser, it may be missing from your Perforce depot, or in a part of the depot other than the part that your local workspace corresponds to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Select the FMOD Studio project you want to create a local copy of, then click the "Open" button at the bottom of the dialog.</p>
<p>FMOD Studio creates a local copy of the selected project in your local workspace, then loads the project.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With that, a local copy of the FMOD Studio project has been created and is loaded. The project's source control settings have automatically been set up, so you'll be able to start working on the project and submitting the changes you make right away.</p>
<p>The <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#status-bar">status bar</span class="dead-link"> updates to show the "Online" icon. For as long as a valid connection is available, this icon appears in the status bar. If a valid connection is not available, perhaps because of an incorrect source control setting or because the connection with the remote repository has been lost, then an "Offline" icon is shown.</p>
<p><img alt="Perforce status icon" src="images/perforceOnlineIcon.png" /></p>
<p>In future, you'll be able to load the project as described in the <a href="using-source-control.html#loading-a-project">loading a project</a> section of this chapter, below.</p>
<p>It is also possible to get a local copy of the project folder by issuing a <code>p4 sync</code> command to the P4 command line, or via P4V. Provided the project was added to the repository correctly, obtaining a local copy of the project this way differs from getting one via "Browse for Project..." only in that it doing so does not automatically set up the project's source control settings.</p>
<h2 id="loading-a-project"><a href="#loading-a-project">13.3 Loading a Project</a></h2>
<p>Loading an FMOD Studio project that uses source control is no different to loading any other FMOD Studio project: Select "File &gt; Open...", then use the ensuing dialog to navigate to and select the FMOD Studio project you wish to load. If there is no local copy of the FMOD Studio project on the machine you are using, see the <a href="using-source-control.html#getting-a-local-copy-of-your-project">getting a local copy of your project</a> section of this chapter.</p>
<p>After loading a project, select "File &gt; Source Control &gt; Sync Latest &amp; Merge Project..." to get all the latest changes to that project from your source control repository.</p>
<h2 id="syncing-a-project"><a href="#syncing-a-project">13.4 Syncing a Project</a></h2>
<p>When multiple people are using source control to collaborate on the same FMOD Studio project, you may notice that some elements of the project are marked with ghosted icons.</p>
<p><img alt="Ghosted Source Control Icons" src="images/ghostedSourceControlIcons.png" /></p>
<p>These icons indicate elements of the project that are being edited by other users.</p>
<p>It is important to regularly synchronize your local copy of the project with the version in your source control repository. This ensures that your local version is the most recent version available, and includes all recent changes and additions.</p>
<p>To synchronize the entire project, select "File &gt; Source Control &gt; Sync Latest &amp; Merge Project..." This gets the latest version of the project from your source control repository.</p>
<p>You can also synchronize individual events, assets, buses, VCAs, parameters, and effects by right-clicking on the item to be synchronized and selecting "Sync Selection" from the source control integration-specific submenu of the context menu.</p>
<h2 id="committing-changes"><a href="#committing-changes">13.5 Committing Changes</a></h2>
<p>After you make changes to a project that uses source control, it is necessary to commit those changes so that they're included in your source control repository.</p>
<p>Elements of the project that have been changed, but whose changes have not yet been committed to the source control repository, are marked with checkmark icons. Similarly, elements that have been added to the project but have not yet been committed are marked with plus sign icons.</p>
<p><img alt="Events with Changes" src="images/eventsWithChanges.png" /></p>
<p>Note that committing changes automatically saves the project.</p>
<p>To commit the changes you've made to an existing project:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Select "File &gt; Source Control &gt; Sync Latest, Merge &amp; Commit..."</p>
<p>A dialog appears, warning you that synchronizing and merging the project is not undoable, and that electing to continue will save the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click "Yes."</p>
<p><img alt="The SMC Confirmation Dialog" src="images/smcConfirmationDialog.png" /></p>
<p>A progress bar dialog shows the project's save progress, followed by a second progress bar dialog that shows the project being prepared for committing changes.</p>
<p>Once saving and preparation is complete, the submit dialog appears. It has two tabs, "Changes" and "On Hold." Under the Changes tab is a list of project elements with changes to be committed.</p>
<p><img alt="The Submit Dialog" src="images/submitDialog.png" /></p>
<p>If there's any elements of the project whose changes you don't want to commit to the repository yet, you can avoid committing them by dragging them onto the On Hold tab. Elements on the On Hold tab are not committed, but will remain marked as changed and can be committed later. If you change your mind about an element that's on hold, you can simply switch to the On Hold tab and drag it onto the Changes tab.</p>
<p><img alt="The On Hold Tab" src="images/onHoldTab.png" /></p>
<p>Note that dragging certain elements of the project onto the On Hold tab or Changes tab automatically causes some related elements to move to that tab as well. This indicates that those elements are all stored in the same file on disk, and so cannot be committed or put on hold individually.</p>
<p>Once you've decided which elements of the project to put on hold and which you want to commit, it's time to send the changed files to the repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click on the "Enter description here" field, and type an appropriate description of the changes you've made.</p>
<p>Whatever you type into the "Enter description here" field is used as the description of the change in your source control repository. It's good practice to write a description that can be easily understood without additional context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click the "Submit" button.</p>
<p>The submit dialog closes, and a progress dialog appears as the changes are committed to the repository. After a few moments, the progress dialog disappears.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With that, the files are committed to the repository, and become available to everyone collaborating on your project the next time they select "File &gt; Source Control &gt; Sync Latest &amp; Merge Project..."</p>
<h3 id="resolving-conflicts"><a href="#resolving-conflicts">13.5.1 Resolving Conflicts</a></h3>
<p>If any of the changed elements that you commit have also been changed by someone else, the conflict resolution dialog appears.</p>
<p><img alt="The Conflict Resolution Dialog" src="images/conflictResolutionDialog.png" /></p>
<p>This dialog lists all the elements of your project that have been changed by other users since you last synchronized your project. In order to finish committing your changes, you must resolve each of the conflicts.</p>
<p>To resolve a conflict, right-click on the element and select "Accept Theirs", "Accept Yours", "Merge", or "Revert" from the context menu.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Selecting "Accept Yours" means that when you click the accept button, your changed version of the element will be committed to your source control repository, while their changes to that element will be discarded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Selecting "Accept Theirs" means that when you click the accept button, their version of the changed element will remain in your source control repository, while your version will be discarded. Note that changes discarded in this manner cannot be recovered.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Selecting "Merge" means that when you click the accept button, FMOD Studio will apply both your changes and the other user's changes to the element, as long as those changes are compatible with each other. If any of your changes is incompatible with a change made by the other user, your change will be committed to the source control repository and their change will be discarded, unless their change was to delete some part of the project, in which case your change will be discarded. Note that if any of your changes are discarded in this manner, they cannot be recovered. For example, if you and the other user added new audio tracks to the same event, the changes are compatible, and both new audio tracks will be present in your source control repository. If you and the other user both set the the master track volume of a particular event to different values, selecting "Merge" will set the volume in your source control repository to the value you specified. Finally, if your change was to set the fader volume of a particular audio track, and the other user's change was to delete that audio track, selecting "Merge" causes the audio track to be deleted in your source control repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Selecting "Revert" causes your version of the changed element to be discarded immediately. This is similar to selecting "Accept Theirs", but your changed version is discarded immediately instead of when you click the accept button. Note that changes discarded in this manner cannot be recovered.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is no one right way to resolve conflicts. If you are uncertain which option to select, consult with the other members of your team.</p>
<h2 id="reverting-changes"><a href="#reverting-changes">13.6 Reverting changes</a></h2>
<p>If you have made changes to your FMOD Studio project that you do not want to keep, it is possible to "revert" the project.</p>
<p>Reverting makes your local copy of the project identical to the version most recently submitted to your source control repository. This effectively undoes every change made to the project since the last time the project was synchronized, even if you've exited and reopened FMOD Studio after making those changes.</p>
<p>If your project's <a href="glossary.html#audio-file">assets</a> are stored in the project folder's assets subdirectory, and source control integration is enabled for assets, reverting the project undoes changes made to your project's assets.</p>
<p>If your project's built banks are stored in the project folder's build subdirectory, and source control integration is enabled for built banks, reverting the project undoes changes to your project's built banks.</p>
<p>To revert the project, select "File &gt; Source Control... &gt; Revert Project..." This command is also found under the source control-specific submenu of the context menu that appears when you right-click on the <a href="glossary.html#events-browser">events browser</a>, <a href="glossary.html#assets-browser">assets browser</a>, <a href="glossary.html#routing-browser">routing browser</a>, <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#parameters-browser">parameters browser</span class="dead-link">, or <span class="dead-link" href="glossary.html#effects-browser">effects browser</span class="dead-link">.</p>
<p>For information on reverting individual elements of a project instead of the entire project, see the <a href="using-source-control.html#committing-changes">committing changes</a> section of this chapter.</p>
<h2 id="working-offline"><a href="#working-offline">13.7 Working Offline</a></h2>
<p>It is sometimes necessary to work on your FMOD Studio project in situations where your project's source control repository is not available, perhaps due to network downtime or working without an internet connection.</p>
<p>If FMOD Studio is unable to connect to the server used by your project's source control repository, you can still freely edit your FMOD Studio project, but you cannot synchronize the project or commit changes, and elements of the project edited by other users are not marked by ghosted icons.</p>
<p>In addition, if you attempt to save the project when FMOD Studio is not connected to your project's source control repository, you will be prompted to disable source control and make files writeable.</p>
<p><img alt="The Disable Source Control and Save Dialog" src="images/disableSourceAndSaveDialog.png" /></p>
<p>Disabling source control in this way means that you will not be able to sync your project or commit changes to your source control repository until you manually re-enable source control for that project.</p>
<p>To re-enable source control for a project that has had source control disabled, open the source control tab of the preferences dialog, and enter your source control settings as if preparing to add your project to your source control repository. (For information on how to add your project to a source control repository, see the <a href="using-source-control.html#adding-your-project-to-a-repository">adding your project to a repository</a> section of this chapter.) Once you have closed the preferences dialog, select "File &gt; Source Control &gt; Identify Local Changes..." to automatically detect changes made since the last time your project was synchronized and committed. Changes detected this way are included in the changes tab of the submit dialog the next time you commit changes.</p>
<h2 id="troubleshooting"><a href="#troubleshooting">13.8 Troubleshooting</a></h2>
<p>FMOD Studio projects subject to source control may occasionally exhibit validation errors, outdated or missing content, or other problems. The following methods may allow you identify or fix these problems.</p>
<p>If you encounter a problem that these troubleshooting methods cannot solve, contact support@fmod.com with a description of the problem.</p>
<h3 id="revert-local-changes"><a href="#revert-local-changes">13.8.1 Revert Local Changes</a></h3>
<p>Reverting the project (as described in the the <a href="using-source-control.html#reverting-changes">reverting changes</a> section of this chapter) can eliminate problems in your local copy of an FMOD Studio project, provided those problems are not also present in the version of your project checked in to your source control repository. Of course, reverting a change effectively undoes that change, so this solution should only be used when the local version of your FMOD Studio project is salvageable.</p>
<h3 id="project-validation"><a href="#project-validation">13.8.2 Project Validation</a></h3>
<p>When multiple users edit related elements of a project, the different changes are merged into a single version of the project that includes all the changes. This merging process can occasionally result in the project containing minor inconsistencies known as "project invalidities."</p>
<p>To detect and fix project invalidities, select "File &gt; Validate Project..."</p>
<p>If a version of your project containing invalidities has been committed to your source control repository, a member of your team should sync their local version of the project as described in the <a href="using-source-control.html#syncing a project">syncing a project</a> section of this chapter, select "File &gt; Validate Project..." as described above, then commit the change to your source control repository as described in the <a href="using-source-control.html#committing-changes">committing changes</a> section of this chapter. All other members of your team should then sync their local versions of the project to that in the source control repository. This process ensures that the version of the project in your source control repository is purged of invalidities, and that everyone collaborating on your project is using that version as a basis for making further changes and additions.</p>
<h3 id="removing-hidden-folders"><a href="#removing-hidden-folders">13.8.3 Removing Hidden Folders</a></h3>
<p>An FMOD Studio project folder may contain <code>.cache</code>, <code>.user</code>, and <code>.unsaved</code> subfolders that store cached build data, user settings, working data. These subfolders allow FMOD Studio to run more efficiently, and allow you to customize FMOD Studio to better suit your needs. These subfolders do not contain any data that affects in-game behavior, and so FMOD Studio does not commit these folders to your source control repository.</p>
<p>However, if they are somehow committed to your source control repository by mistake, they may result in syncing and committing changes taking longer than necessary, increased project size on disk, and user settings being overwritten when syncing the project.</p>
<p>If the <code>.cache</code>, <code>.user</code>, or <code>.unsaved</code> subfolder of an FMOD Studio project has been included in your source control repository, removing that folder from your source control repository should result in improved performance.</p>
<p>If the <code>.cache</code>, <code>.user</code>, or <code>.unsaved</code> subfolders reappear in your source control repository after being removed, it may mean that an external tool used by your team (such as P4V or tortoiseSVN) has been configured to commit files in those folders to the repository. If so, ask your source control administrator to reconfigure the tool.</p></div>
