You know when you get good news and you know you’re supposed to be happy?
And you're just not?
Catnip chronicles was just that.
A phone call and an interview in, I could tell it was a good place.
What I had studied for.
Yet I just wasn’t invigorated by the offer.
I took it. The rent was due and the pay was good.
And I did like the work …
I suppose along the way I just got resentful that I had to monetise my passion for the privilege of continuing to breathe. 
Morrigan: You going to take it?
Sibeil: I should….
Morrigan: But?
Sibeil: I just…. Dont if that makes sense? I’m just not feeling it.
Morrigan: Then take it and use it as a support while you get a better job
Sibeil: Yeah i suppose your right...
You smile.
I still feel a sinking feeling in my gut.
