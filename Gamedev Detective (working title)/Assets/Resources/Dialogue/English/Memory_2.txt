Splash splash!
Holding onto my mama’s hand, I remember jumping in every puddle I could find.
Back then when we lived in La Rochelle, trips to the city were small treats.
I had loved the rain, even back then.
The streets familiar, the people known.
A feeling of home, that I seldom had here.
This particular time we had travelled into the city was to put affairs in order
I was too young to really care or understand, the puddles being my main source of interest.
We would move a week later.
I feel you squeeze my hand.
I shake myself out of my reverie.
Morrigan: You okay?
Sibeil: ‘Just thinking about old memories’. Or ‘ yeah, where do you want to eat?’
