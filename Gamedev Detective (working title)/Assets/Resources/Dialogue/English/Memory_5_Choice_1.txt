I told you I would.
But somewhere along the drive to the party, I turned around.
I returned to the house.
Since the hospital, I had taken to sleeping there, leaving our home empty.
Walking through it now, the shell seemed hollow.
The moonlight made our home feel cold and distant.
I just sat for hours on the bed.
