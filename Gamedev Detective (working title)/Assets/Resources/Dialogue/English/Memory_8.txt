Kiss me, I am not your foe
Fill me, I can find you
Bind you, One from many
There is more suffering in life then death
You fear my end to your loneliness
Only I love
You ache in birth
You ache in Choice
You ache in growth
I promise no ache
A am heaven eternal
I will wipe your pain away
Do not kill me, Kiss me
You are earthâ€™s child
I am the thread of love for you
I am not death, I am life
Flesh of the earth, You hurt me
I shield the weak, The unseen
Gold Sorrell
Your hands tremble
I ache to help
Listen, abiding is better
Life is manyfold
Flow me, From body to body
Am i not kindly
An open wound 
An invitation
A man is made of weakness
You flow like vines
That which is sick is Beauty
You fear beauty
They are weak, You are fearful 
It is a boon
It hurts to outgrow
It hurts to run
It hurts to break your shell
Behold me, Deeply
No lost, I am here
