Sibeil: ‘Nem, mama’ 
I listen to my mother.
She’s worried about the new move.
We were no longer in the same country.
I had stayed in Dublin, while she had moved with David to Scotland.
She had offered a place to me but…
That felt like regression.
I would be fine, I said. Maybe. Work was heating up. Not true.
I had met someone interesting. Definitely.
