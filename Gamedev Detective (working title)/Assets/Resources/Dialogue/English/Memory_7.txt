You are finally home.
You look tired
I know your cases have been weighing on you lately
I don’t want to add to that 
Morrigan: Is it okay if I work in the study while I eat?
No
Sibeil: Of course
We haven’t talked in ages
Sibeil: I know how important this case is
Don’t cry. Don’t Cry
Sibeil : Do you need me to bring in anything for you?
Cant you see I need you now?
Morrigan: No thank you. I really appreciate it. Thanks hun.
Sibeil: Love you
Morrigan: Love you too
No you dont.
That’s not fair, I know.
I had hoped you would be able to come with me to the pharmacy.
Im tired 
So tired
Maybe I will sleep for a bit
I don’t feel hungry
The pills can wait for another day.
