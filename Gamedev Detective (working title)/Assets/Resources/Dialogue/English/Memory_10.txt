I watch you sleep.
I know what I have to do.
But now that the moment is here, I'm full of doubt.
This life i am living is a slow suicide.
I feel numb, apathy creeping in.
Passions I once had bring no joy
The water of debt and responsibility threaten to choke me.
I try to explain this, but I never seem to find the words that make you understand.
I need change.
The shackles around my neck need to be broken
Even if that means breaking the good with the bad.
I brush the hair out of your face.
You do not rustle or move.
One part of me wants to bring you with me.
I know it's not fair what I'm doing.
But the other part of me knows it's not fair to drag you along in my problems
I  need to fix this.
I feel like recently I have been drifting along in friendships, relationships.
People  I used to be so honest with, I lie to now on a daily basis.
Even in the crowd of friends, I feel lonely.
Buying those tickets felt like finding the key.
Now I just need to unlock those shackles.
