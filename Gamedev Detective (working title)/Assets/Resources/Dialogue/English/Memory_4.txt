Beep...Beep (sounds effect)
Head in my hands I wait for you.
12 hours, 
12 hours later, youâ€™re still in surgery.
You had collapsed at work.
At first I thought it was you overworking yourself.
Like I had said.
Doctors say it was the shunt grown up from your spine to the brain.
Sitting here now, the signs something wasn't right were there.
But you insisted you were fine.
Clawing, nawning, I feel the darkness set in.
